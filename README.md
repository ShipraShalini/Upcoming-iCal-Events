A widget made for [Ãœbersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/) using *CoffeeScript*, syncs upcoming events from your iCalendar  

The [iCalBuddy](http://hasseg.org/icalBuddy/) command-line utility tool must be installed to run. If you install to a different directory than standard, you will need to change the path in the *command* line. iCalBuddy can be installed via brew:

```
brew install ical-buddy
```

If you want to show Google calendar events, just link your Google calendar to iCal, details can be found here: http://usingtechnologybetter.com/google-calendars-and-ical/

## Bug Fixes

This widget was originally designed in a few hours and was mainly for personal use, until 500 downloads happened. At the moment i'm trying to make it a bit more robust, so i'll be be pushing out an Update to the parser soon. If you find any issues or bugs, please log an Issue here.
